## What is move?
Move is an exciting new application that reminds users to get up and move around to stay healthy.

## How to

### install the application
Boot up your webserver (I use <a href="http://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a> as my code editor that comes with a server) or import as a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/apps/first_app#five" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a> (recommended until the app becomes available on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a>).

### use the application
Once the application is installed, press "Start sitting timer" to start the countdown while sitting. As of now, the timer will start at one hour and count down to 0. When the timer hits 0, a notification will appear alerting you to get up and move. Once you get up, click "Start move timer" to start the timer at one minute. When the timer expires, a notification will appearing alerting you to sit down. After sitting down, restart the process by clicking "Start sitting timer" once again.
